# CS_Probing
The Official data repository for COLING 2022 paper _"Are Visual-Linguistic Models Commonsense Knowledge Bases?"_.

We release the two datasets used in the commonsense knowledge probing experiemnts: (1) [**CWWV_IMG**](#cwwv_img) (2) **CWWV_CLIP**.

**CWWV_IMG**: is automatically generated by following the procedures proposed by [Ma et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03863).

Additionaly, we rely on an effcient image retrieval process to compensate the missing image sources (please refer to our paper for details).

An overview can be seen in the below diagram.

**CWWV_CLIP**: is a subset of CWWV_IMG that contains higher quality of image-word pair according to [CLIPScore](https://github.com/jmhessel/clipscore).
